🌱 EcoTrack – Sustainability Data Analysis using Python

EcoTrack is a data-driven project developed under the AICTE Virtual Internship (Edunet Foundation).
It focuses on analyzing sustainability-related datasets to identify environmental and social impact trends using Python.



🎯 Objective

To analyze sustainability data and derive insights related to energy consumption, waste management, and carbon emissions, thereby promoting data-backed sustainable solutions.



⚙ Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Version: 3.13.7

IDE / Environment: PyCharm

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Dataset Format: CSV file




📊 Project Workflow

1. Data Collection – Dataset sourced from Kaggle.


2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Removing missing or inconsistent values.


3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding relationships and key patterns.


4. Visualization of Trends – Using Python libraries for data visualization.


5. Model Training (Week 2) – Building a regression model to predict carbon emissions.


6. Evaluation – Calculating metrics like MSE, MAE, and R².


7. Interpretation of Results – Deriving insights for sustainable decision-making.





📁 Dataset

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle under the sustainability and environment category.
File Name: Carbon Emission.csv

📅 Internship Progress

Week 1 – Setup & Data Understanding

Created the project repository and initialized version control.

Collected sustainability-related data from Kaggle.

Understood dataset structure, features, and types of attributes.

Documented dataset description and project overview.


Week 2 – Model Training & Evaluation

Preprocessed the dataset by encoding categorical values.

Trained a regression model to predict carbon emissions.

Evaluated the model using metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R² Score.

Saved the trained model (eco_model.pkl) and metadata (model_meta.pkl).

Generated and uploaded week2_report.txt to the repository.



📊 Results

Model successfully trained with satisfactory accuracy.

Evaluation metrics indicate good predictive capability.

Ready for next phase — model deployment and real-time data integration.
