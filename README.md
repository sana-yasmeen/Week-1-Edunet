🌱 EcoTrack – Tracking Sustainability Through Data

I’m excited to share my project EcoTrack, developed as part of the AICTE Virtual Internship (Edunet Foundation). This project focuses on analyzing sustainability-related datasets and uncovering meaningful environmental insights using Python and Machine Learning.

🎯 Objective

To analyze sustainability data—such as energy usage, waste management, and carbon emissions—and generate actionable insights that promote data-driven sustainable solutions.

⚙ Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python (v3.13.7)

IDE: PyCharm

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Dataset Format: CSV

📊 Project Workflow

Data Collection: Dataset sourced from Kaggle (Carbon Emission.csv)

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values and ensuring consistent formats

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, correlations, and patterns

Data Visualization: Representing insights using graphs and plots

Model Training: Regression model to predict carbon emissions

Model Evaluation: Metrics used — MSE, MAE, R²

Interpretation: Turning model results into sustainability-focused insights
